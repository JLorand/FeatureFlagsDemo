## Feature Flagging
## Introduction
### What is Feature Flagging?
Feature Flagging is a software development technique that allows developers to turn certain features on or off without deploying new code. This is done by wrapping the code in a conditional statement that checks if the feature flag is enabled. This allows developers to test new features in production without affecting end users.

### Why Use Feature Flagging?
Feature Flagging has many benefits, including:
- **Reduced Risk**: By turning features on or off with feature flags, developers can reduce the risk of deploying new code.
- **Incremental Rollouts**: Feature flags allow developers to gradually roll out new features to a subset of users before making them available to everyone.
- **A/B Testing**: Feature flags can be used to test different versions of a feature with different groups of users.
- **Hotfixes**: Feature flags can be used to quickly turn off a feature if it is causing issues in production.
- **Feature Toggles**: Feature flags can be used to toggle features on or off based on user preferences.
- **Configuration Management**: Feature flags can be used to manage configuration settings for different environments.

### Feature Flagging Best Practices
When implementing feature flags, it is important to follow best practices to ensure that they are used effectively. Some best practices include:
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive names for feature flags to make it clear what they do.
- **Limit Scope**: Limit the scope of feature flags to avoid creating too many flags.
- **Remove Dead Flags**: Remove feature flags that are no longer needed to avoid cluttering the codebase.
- **Monitor Flags**: Monitor feature flags to ensure they are being used correctly and are not causing issues in production.
- **Automate Testing**: Automate testing of feature flags to ensure they are working as expected.
- **Document Flags**: Document feature flags to make it clear what they do and how they should be used.
- **Use Feature Flagging Tools**: Use feature flagging tools to make it easier to manage feature flags and track their usage.

## Feature Flagging Tools
- **Custom Implementation**: Developers can implement feature flags using custom code, such as if statements or configuration files.
- **Feature Flagging Libraries**: There are many feature flagging libraries available that provide a set of tools and APIs for implementing feature flags.

## Adding Feature Flags to a .NET Application

Add the **Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore** NuGet package to the project.

```csharp
using Microsoft.FeatureManagement;

builder.Services.AddFeatureManagement();
```

Create the flags in the config/appsettings file
```json
{
    "FeatureManagement": {
        "FeatureA": true, // Feature flag set to on
        "FeatureB": false, // Feature flag set to off
        "FeatureC": {
            "EnabledFor": [
                {
                    "Name": "Percentage",
                    "Parameters": {
                        "Value": 50
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}

```

Create Feature Flag References

```csharp
public static class MyFeatureFlags
{
    public const string FeatureA = "FeatureA";
    public const string FeatureB = "FeatureB";
    public const string FeatureC = "FeatureC";
}
```

Inject the IFeatureManager
```csharp
using Microsoft.FeatureManagement;

public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly IFeatureManager _featureManager;
    
    public HomeController(ILogger<HomeController> logger, IFeatureManager featureManager)
    {
        _featureManager = featureManager;
    }
}
```

Access the feature flags via the FeatureManager
```csharp
if (await _featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(MyFeatureFlags.FeatureA))
{
    // Run the following code
}
```

## Conclusion
Feature Flagging is a powerful technique that allows developers to control the rollout of new features and manage configuration settings in production. By following best practices and using feature flagging tools, developers can effectively use feature flags to reduce risk and improve the development process.
